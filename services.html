              <p>
                We perform simple extractions. During a simple extraction, the
                doctor will numb the area around the tooth using a local
                anesthetic to lessen any discomfort. After the extraction we
                will advise you of the proper post extraction care.

              <p>
                Many disease and conditions of the teeth and gums cannot be seen
                by the naked eye. Therefore, X-ray examinations are needed.

              <h3>Root Canal</h3>
              <p>
                Your teeth are held in the jaw by roots. Inside each tooth is
                the pulp, which supplies nutrients to the tooth. Decay or trauma
                can cause the pulp to die. If this pulp is not removed, your
                tooth can become infected. Root Canal Therapy involves removing
                the infected nerve and dead pulp, and then sealing off the tooth
                to protect it.

              <h3>White Filling</h3>
              <p>
                For over 150 years standard fillings have been made out of a
                silvery-grey material called ‘amalgam’. This is still one of the
                strongest and longest-lasting materials available for fillings.
                However, many people find it unattractive and some are concerned
                about possible health risks. White fillings are now becoming a
                popular alternative to amalgam fillings. The new dental
                materials mean it is much easier to find a perfect match for the
                shade of a particular tooth. In most cases, it is quite
                impossible to see that the tooth even has a filling.

              <h3>Prophylaxis</h3>
              <p>
                This is the term applied to the removal of plaque and tartar
                from teeth and gums. This is a prevention measure to avoid tooth
                decay and gum disease. It also maintains good breath and
                unstained teeth. Our office provides regular access to these
                hygiene techniques. All procedure are carried out by a fully
                qualified dental hygienist. Our staff will inform you of your
                upcoming, six monthly appointments.

              <p>
                Crowns are used to repair decays, broken, severely discolored or
                misaligned teeth. Crowns can also support a weak tooth or a
                tooth with a large filling. Crowns are used to strengthen and
                improve the appearance of your teeth.

              <p>
                Dentures are artificial and removable replacement teeth.
                Complete dentures are used to replace all teeth and partials are
                intended to replace a section of missing teeth. Dentures improve
                chewing and speech as well as your smile.
